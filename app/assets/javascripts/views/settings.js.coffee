I mean, you don't have to but it'd be nice to know.\n\nIf you wish to proceed, you should know that account destruction is permanent. It's final, irreversible, terminal and an all around bummer. In fact, I'd prefer you clicked \"Cancel\" and ended this foolishness right now.\n\nBut if you really must go through with it, this is also a good time to mention that you can export all your data from the \"extras\" tab.\n\nWhen you've made your peace and said your last words, click \"OK\" to begin ultimate destruction."
