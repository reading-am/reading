Well <%= @user.first_name %>, it's been real.

I wanted to take this chance to say goodbye since, the moment
after this email was sent, all of @<%= @user.username %>'s data was deleted.
Poof! Just like thatâ€“gone.

But even though your old self is a smoldering crater, there's
always time for new beginnings; today is a great day to start a
new Reading account: http://<%= DOMAIN %>

Okay okay, I'll leave you alone. No more emails, no more fantastic
friends, none of that. But if you'd like one more hurrah, just one
more gag for old times, respond to this email and I'll say hello back.
I'll even pretend like you didn't just break up with us. That's just
the sort of guy I am.
