  # The original idea was that the referrer_post_id didn't
  # have to dictate the :url param - that way we could
  # eventually mix and match 'because of' with different
  # end results. Otherwise we could just forward straight
  # without the intermediate page.
  # I've considered doing this with the URL shortener,
  # but Rails make sharing code between controller methods
  # a pain in the ass
