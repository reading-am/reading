Hi <%= @user.first_name %>,

Max and I wanted to welcome you to Reading. We're a small community here
and we'd love to get to know you - just respond to this email and say hello.

Reading is a feed of all the things that you're, well, reading. It's not just
for the best stuff, it's for anything that you might ask a friend "Hey, did
you read that? Wasn't it great / weird / crazy / funny / stupid / ... ?".

To help you get started, here are the high points:

** Posting **
Posting to your Reading account is a simple one click operation.
Just install the bookmarklet, or one of our browser extensions
(available for Chrome, Safar, and Firefox), and you're ready to go.
You can find them here:

http://<%= DOMAIN %>/settings/extras

When you post, you'll notice two buttons: "Yep" and "Nope".
They're a quick way to say what you think about the page.

** Your Profile **
Everything you post to Reading will show up on your profile:

http://<%= DOMAIN %>/<%= @user.username %>

Posts you've "Yep"d will have a green checkmark next to them
and posts you've "Nope"d will be crossed out in red.
If you'd like to delete a post, simply hover over it to see
a red delete button. You can't miss it.

** Following **
The best part about Reading is seeing what other people are reading,
and "following" makes that easy. When you visit a user's profile,
you'll see a green "Follow" button. Click it, and that user's posts
will show up in your "Following Posts" here:

http://<%= DOMAIN %>/<%= @user.username %>/list 

To get you started, you can find some great people to follow here:

http://<%= DOMAIN %>/users/recommended

** Hooks **
Hooks plug into your favorite sites and perform actions each time you
do something on Reading, like posting to Twitter or Facebook when you
read a page or saving all of your "Yep"s to Instapaper for offline reading.
They're a great way to share your posts with friends outside of Reading.

That's about it for now. We hope you have a good time and remember, say hello!
