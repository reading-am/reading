<div id="suspended" class="span8">
  <p>
    Awwww man, this account has been suspended for some reason or another.
    Why not try visiting the <a href="/everybody">homepage</a> instead?
  </p>
  <p>
  If this is your account, fear notâ€”getting unsuspended is probably pretty easy, just
  <%= mail_to "help@#{ROOT_DOMAIN}", 'click here', :subject => "Help! I've been suspended!", :body => "My account is #{ROOT_URL}/#{current_user.username rescue nil} and I love using Reading for:", :encode => 'javascript', :class => 'email' %>
  to shoot us an email and we'll get you fixed right up. Make sure to
  include a little bit about yourself so we know you're human with a healthy love of reading.
