<div id="blank_slate">
<% if current_user && @user == current_user %>
  You haven't posted anything that you're reading yet. If you had, you'd see it here.<br>
  To get started, drag this link to your bookmarks bar:<br>
  <%= link_to 'âœŒ Reading', bookmarklet_url(current_user), :alt => 'Drag me to your bookmarks bar', :class => 'bookmarklet' if current_user and current_user == @user %><br>
  When you visit a webpage you're about to start reading, press that bookmark. That's it. Also:
  <ul>
    <li>Don't wait until after you've read it.</li>
    <li>Don't think too much about it.</li>
    <li>Don't worry about whether the content is good or bad or boring or interesting,<br> everyone else will figure that out for themselves.</li>
  </ul>
<% else %>
  <%= @user.display_name %> hasn't posted anything yet
<% end %>
</div>
