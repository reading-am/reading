Hey <%= @user.first_name %>,

<%= @comment.user.display_name %> invited you to help us kick the
tires on a new feature --> comments!

## The Short Of It ##
The next time you use Reading on any page, you'll see a comment box.
Type something in, hit return and we'll pin it to the page. You can
also @mention (ala Twitter) the username of any user you follow and
they'll receive an email invite just like the one you're reading now.

For best results, install one of our browser extensions (http://<%= DOMAIN %>/settings/extras)
and remember, you'll only see comments once you've used Reading on the page.

## The Long Of It ##
We think there's a lot to talk about in the things we read
and we're slowly figuring out how to help those conversations along.
Reading Comments are in alpha and, as such, there are plenty of things
that still need a little love. As an alpha tester, it's your responsibility
to help us make this the best thing ever. Email us, call us, mention us in
comments and give us an all around hard time.

But enough about the things that don't work, here are a few that do.
Within the comment box you can:

-- Put "quotes" around any text from the page and it'll be auto linked on the page.

-- If you paste in an image url, or drag an image from the page onto the comment box, the image will appear within your comment.

-- Put `backticks` around code and it'll show up in a monospaced font.

-- Hitting return will post your comment, but if you'd like a new line you can use alt + return.

-- For bonus points, try pasting in a URL to a Tweet or a Wikipedia page.

Thats it for now. Thanks for jumping in and if you have any feedback,
just respond to this email. We're excited to see how it all pans out.
