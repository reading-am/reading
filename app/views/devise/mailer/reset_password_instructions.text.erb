Hi <%= @resource.first_name %>(@<%= @resource.username %>),

Someone requested a link to change your password, which you can do by visiting the link below.

<%= edit_password_url(@resource, reset_password_token: @token) %>

If you didn't request this, would you mind responding to this email to let me know?
Don't worry, your password won't change until you visit the link above and create a new one.
