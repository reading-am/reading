Well <%= @user.first_name %>, it's been real.

Max and I wanted to take this chance to say goodbye since, the moment
after this email was sent, we deleted all of @<%= @user.username %>'s user data.
Poof! Just like thatâ€“gone.

But even though your old self is a smoldering crater, there's always time for new
beginnings; today is a great day to start a new Reading account: http://reading.am

Okay okay, we'll leave you alone. No more emails, no more fantastic friends,
none of that. But if you'd like one more hurrah, just one more gag for old times,
respond to this email and we'll say hello back. We'll even pretend like you
didn't just break up with us. That's just the sort of guys we are.
